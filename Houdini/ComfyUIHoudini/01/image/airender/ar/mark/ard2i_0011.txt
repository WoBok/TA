Seed: 555.0
Prompt: A lone traveler in a tattered cloak rides a horse across a desolate desert wasteland at sunset. The air is thick with cinematic fog and atmospheric dust, creating dramatic depth haze. In the distance stands a towering dystopian sci-fi city — massive, monolithic buildings made of tightly packed geometric blocks, sharp-edged and angular. The structures are vertically stretched and filled with mechanical detail: extruding cube modules, antenna arrays, cooling vents, stacked machinery, and glowing industrial seams. Everything feels cold, alien, and decaying — like a ruined space megacity after a collapse. The architecture is brutalist, asymmetric, and extremely dense, resembling a collapsed cyberpunk space station on a planetary surface. The sunlight glows through the fog, casting long shadows. Inspired by Blade Runner 2049, with post-apocalyptic silence and monumental scale. Ultra detailed, cinematic atmosphere, 8K concept art, wide shot.
